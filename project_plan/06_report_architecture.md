# Report Architecture

## Overview

Documentation structure and automated report generation system for the Universal Critical Restoration Conjecture analysis. This architecture handles multi-configuration experiments and produces publication-quality reports with mathematical typesetting.

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Research hypothesis and approach
- Key findings across all experiments
- Quantitative results summary
- Mathematical significance assessment

### 2. Mathematical Framework
- Energy functional definition: $E[S] = \sum_k |D_S(\varphi_k)|^2$
- Universal Critical Restoration conjecture statement
- Perturbation analysis: $\Delta E(\delta) = C_1\delta^2 + C_2\delta^3 + O(\delta^4)$
- Theoretical foundations and motivation

### 3. Experimental Methodology
- Three-experiment pipeline design
- Statistical analysis methods
- Configuration management approach
- Cross-experiment validation

### 4. Experiment Results
Each experiment section includes:
- Configuration space coverage
- Statistical analysis results
- Key visualizations
- Stability assessment
- Mathematical interpretation

### 5. Cross-Experiment Analysis
- Universal stability confirmation
- Scaling law validation
- Statistical robustness assessment
- Methodology consistency

### 6. Conclusions
- Evidence synthesis across scales
- Theoretical implications
- Future research directions
## Implementation Architecture

### Report Generation System
Located in `analysis/` directory:
- `generate_markdown.py` - Comprehensive markdown report generator
- `generate_pdf.py` - PDF generation with LaTeX math rendering
- `custom_template.html` - HTML template for PDF conversion

### Data Integration
The system aggregates results from:
- `experiment1/results/` - Single-zero perturbation analysis
- `experiment2/results/` - Two-zero interaction analysis  
- `experiment3/results/` - Multi-zero scaling analysis

### Image Management
- Images copied directly from experiment results to `results/images/`
- Key visualizations selected based on analysis importance
- Professional captions generated from filename patterns
- Images referenced in markdown with relative paths

### Output Generation
Reports generated in `results/` directory:
- `universal_critical_restoration_conjecture_analysis.md` - Markdown report
- `universal_critical_restoration_conjecture_analysis.pdf` - PDF with math rendering
- `images/` - Key visualizations from all experiments

## Technical Implementation

### Data Extraction Patterns
- Configuration metadata from JSON files
- Statistical results from text summary files
- Visualization selection from image directories
- Cross-experiment metric aggregation

### Mathematical Typesetting
- LaTeX mathematics in markdown source
- Pandoc converts markdown to HTML with MathJax
- Chrome headless renders HTML+MathJax to PDF
- Professional equation formatting and symbols

### Report Structure Generation
- Dynamic section creation based on available data
- Multi-configuration experiment handling
- Cross-experiment synthesis tables
- Statistical significance reporting

This architecture provides a reusable framework for generating comprehensive analysis reports from systematic mathematical experiments.
