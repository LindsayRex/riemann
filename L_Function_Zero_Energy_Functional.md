# L-Function Zero Energy Functional and Critical Line Stability

Weil’s explicit formula links sums over L-function zeros and sums over primes [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org). Motivated by this, we define an “energy” functional measuring deviations of a putative zero set \( S \) from the ideal critical-line configuration \( S_c \). Our framework is:

**Energy functional \( E[S] \)**: Let \( D_S(s) \geq 0 \) be a nonnegative disturbance field induced by zeros in \( S \), symmetric under \( s \mapsto 1-s \). Define

\[
E[S] = \int_{\mathbb{C}} D_S(s) \, d\mu(s),
\]

where \( d\mu \) is Lebesgue measure [vixra.org](https://vixra.org). In particular, by Lemma 2.6 one has \( D_S(s) \geq 0 \) and \( D_S(s) = D_S(1-s) \) [vixra.org](https://vixra.org), so \( E[S] \) is minimized exactly when \( S \) is symmetric about \( \Re(s) = 1/2 \) (i.e.\ all zeros lie on the critical line).

**Discrepancy operator \( D_S(\varphi) \)**: For a smooth test function \( \varphi \) (even, compactly supported), define \( D_S(\varphi) \) as the difference between the weighted sum of \( \varphi \) over zeros in \( S \) and the corresponding prime-sum from the Weil formula. Concretely,

\[
D_S(\varphi) = \sum_{\rho \in S} \varphi(\Im \rho) - P(\varphi),
\]

where \( P(\varphi) \) is the prime/archimedean contribution from the explicit formula [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org). Under the ideal configuration \( S_c \) (all zeros at \( \Re(s) = 1/2 \)), one expects \( D_{S_c}(\varphi) = 0 \) for admissible \( \varphi \), whereas nonzero \( D_S(\varphi) \) indicates an energy penalty.

**Test-function basis**: We choose a finite orthonormal basis \( \{ \varphi_j \} \) of smooth even functions (e.g.\ Gaussian pulses or Fourier modes) on \( \mathbb{R} \). The energy can be viewed as a quadratic form in the coefficients \( D_S(\varphi_j) \): for appropriate weights \( w_j > 0 \),

\[
E[S] \approx \sum_j w_j (D_S(\varphi_j))^2.
\]

This makes \( E[S] \) a positive semi-definite functional of the discrepancy data.

**Critical-line configuration \( S_c \)**: Let \( S_c = \{ \rho_j = 1/2 + i \gamma_j \} \) denote the conjectured zero-set on the critical line. We consider small real shifts \( \rho_j(\delta) = 1/2 + \delta_j + i \gamma_j \) of one or more zeros off the line. The goal is to examine how \( E[S_c + \{ \delta_j \}] \) changes as a function of the perturbations \( \delta_j \).

**Conjecture (Universal Critical Restoration)**: We conjecture that \( S_c \) is a strict local minimizer of \( E \). Equivalently, the energy gradient vanishes at \( S_c \) (\( \nabla E(S_c) = 0 \)) and \( \nabla E \) for nearby configurations points back toward \( S_c \). In particular, any perturbation off the line increases energy. Lemma 3.4 in [21] shows that for a single zero \( \rho = 1/2 + i \gamma \), a small real shift \( \rho(\varepsilon) = 1/2 + \varepsilon + i \gamma \) satisfies \( \left. \frac{dE}{d\varepsilon} \right|_{\varepsilon = 0} = 0 \) and \( \left. \frac{d^2 E}{d\varepsilon^2} \right|_{\varepsilon = 0} > 0 \), confirming that \( S_c \) is a strict local minimum of \( E \). More generally, Theorem 3.3 implies that any asymmetric configuration \( \Gamma \) has \( E(\Gamma) > E(\Gamma^\sharp) \), where \( \Gamma^\sharp \) is the symmetrized set. Thus the critical-line is energetically favored, justifying the study of perturbations around \( S_c \).

**Perturbation framework**: By the above symmetry, the first-order variation of \( E \) at \( S_c \) vanishes. Thus for a small offset \( \delta \) we expand the energy difference

\[
\Delta E(\delta; \gamma) = E[S_c(\delta)] - E[S_c]
\]

in powers of \( \delta \). The second-order term must be positive (since \( D_S(s) \geq 0 \) ensures positive local curvature [vixra.org](https://vixra.org)). Hence we anticipate a quadratic leading behavior, with higher-order terms capturing interactions.

## 2. Hypothesis and Research Objective

We hypothesize that a single-zero perturbation yields an energy expansion of the form

\[
\Delta E(\delta, \gamma) = C_1(\gamma) \, \delta^2 - C_2(\gamma) \, \delta^3 + O(\delta^4),
\]

for small real \( \delta \). Here \( C_1(\gamma) > 0 \) (ensuring a local minimum) and \( C_2(\gamma) \) encodes cubic-order effects. The research objectives are:

**Local stability (\( C_1 > 0 \))**: A positive \( C_1(\gamma) \) for all tested heights \( \gamma \) would prove that infinitesimal shifts increase energy to leading order, confirming the local stability of \( S_c \). Thus our aim is to compute \( C_1(\gamma) = \frac{1}{2} E''(0) \) numerically and verify \( C_1 > 0 \).

**Interference terms (\( C_2, \dots \))**: The coefficient \( C_2(\gamma) \) arises from asymmetry and multi-zero interactions. We will bound \( |C_2(\gamma)| \) relative to \( C_1(\gamma) \) to ensure it cannot produce a net decrease in \( E \) at moderate \( \delta \). In practice, this means numerically fitting the cubic term and checking that \( C_2 \) is sufficiently small (or negative) so that the \( \delta^2 \) term dominates for \( |\delta| \ll 1 \).

**Mathematical strategies**: Proving these properties will require new estimates and inequalities. For instance, one must show the second-variation operator is positive definite (an operator-positivity theorem) so that \( E''(0) > 0 \). One must also derive asymptotic estimates (e.g.\ via Fourier analysis of \( D_S \)) to control the \( O(\delta^4) \) remainder. We expect to develop explicit inequalities for the higher-order terms, bounding interference sums by integrals or known zeta-estimates. Overall, the “new math” includes coercivity bounds for the Hessian of \( E \), asymptotic expansions of \( \Delta E \), and quantitative remainder estimates, all needed to support the local-stability claim.

## 3. Experimental Design

### Experiment 1: Single-Zero Perturbation

**Objective**: Test the quadratic behavior of \( \Delta E \) for a single zero. Specifically, verify \( \Delta E(\delta) \approx C_1 \delta^2 \) and estimate \( C_1, C_2 \).

**Setup**: Let \( N = 1 \) (one zero). Fix a height \( \gamma \) (e.g.\ \( \gamma \approx 10 \) or another mid-range value) and consider the configuration \( S_c = \{ 1/2 + i \gamma \} \). Vary the real part by \( \delta \in [-\Delta, \Delta] \) for small \( \Delta \) (e.g.\ \( \Delta = 0.1 \) in steps of 0.005). Compute \( E[S_c(\delta)] \) for each \( \delta \).

**Data collected**: Record \( \Delta E(\delta) = E[S_c(\delta)] - E[S_c] \) and approximate \( \nabla E = (\Delta E / \delta) \) for small \( \delta \). Since \( N = 1 \), “interference” is zero; we focus on \( \Delta E \) vs.\ \( \delta \).

**Expected plots**: \( \Delta E \) vs.\ \( \delta \) should be roughly a parabola symmetric about \( \delta = 0 \), opening upward (since \( C_1 > 0 \)). A plot of \( \Delta E \) vs.\ \( \delta^2 \) should be nearly linear. The slope \( E' / \delta \) vs.\ \( \delta \) (or finite-difference derivative) should approach \( 2 C_1 \) at \( \delta = 0 \).

**Statistical plan**: Fit the data to a cubic polynomial \( \Delta E(\delta) = a \delta^2 + b \delta^3 \) (forcing \( \Delta E(0) = 0 \)). Estimate \( a = C_1, b = -C_2 \) by least squares. Compute the residual variance and standard errors of \( a, b \). Use bootstrap resampling (randomly subsample the \( (\delta, \Delta E) \) pairs) to assess the stability of the fit and to obtain confidence intervals for \( C_1, C_2 \). Test the null hypothesis \( C_1 > 0 \) (one-sided): e.g.\ compute a p-value for \( a \leq 0 \) under the fit. We expect a highly significant positive \( a \) and an insignificant or small negative \( b \).

### Experiment 2: Two-Zero Interaction

**Objective**: Measure how simultaneous perturbations of two zeros interact (interference). In particular, test whether the energy change is additive or if cross-terms appear.

**Setup**: Let \( N = 2 \) with zeros at \( \{ 1/2 + i \gamma_1, 1/2 + i \gamma_2 \} \), choosing two distinct heights (e.g.\ \( \gamma_1 = 10 \), \( \gamma_2 = 20 \)). We consider two perturbation schemes: (i) shift the first zero by \( \delta \) while keeping the second fixed; (ii) shift both zeros by the same \( \delta \). As before, vary \( \delta \in [-\Delta, \Delta] \) in small steps.

**Data collected**: For each scheme compute \( \Delta E_1(\delta) = E[\{ \rho_1(\delta), \rho_2 \}] - E[S_c] \), \( \Delta E_2(\delta) = E[\{ \rho_1, \rho_2(\delta) \}] - E[S_c] \), and \( \Delta E_{12}(\delta) = E[\{ \rho_1(\delta), \rho_2(\delta) \}] - E[S_c] \). Define the interference ratio

\[
I(\delta) = \frac{\Delta E_{12}(\delta) - (\Delta E_1(\delta) + \Delta E_2(\delta))}{|\Delta E_1(\delta) + \Delta E_2(\delta)|},
\]

which should be zero if the effects are additive. We also record \( \nabla E \) components for each zero.

**Expected plots**: Plot each \( \Delta E(\delta) \) vs.\ \( \delta \). The curves for \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \) should be parabolic with coefficients \( C_1(\gamma_1) \) and \( C_1(\gamma_2) \). The combined \( \Delta E_{12} \) may deviate slightly due to interference. Plot \( I(\delta) \) vs.\ \( \delta \) to visualize any nonlinear coupling; ideally \( I(\delta) \approx 0 \).

**Statistical plan**: Fit polynomial models separately for \( \Delta E_1, \Delta E_2, \Delta E_{12} \) (e.g.\ quadratic or cubic fits). Estimate \( C_1(\gamma_j) \) for \( j = 1, 2 \) and the effective coefficients for the joint case. Analyze if \( C_1^{(12)} \approx C_1(\gamma_1) + C_1(\gamma_2) \). Compute confidence intervals for the difference \( C_1^{(12)} - (C_1(\gamma_1) + C_1(\gamma_2)) \); use these to test if interference is significant. Bootstrap the residuals of each fit to estimate the variance of interaction terms. Also evaluate p-values for testing \( I(\delta) = 0 \) across the sampled range.

### Experiment 3: Multi-Zero Scaling

**Objective**: Examine how \( \Delta E \) scales when perturbing many zeros simultaneously and test the robustness of the quadratic law as \( N \) grows. This checks for higher-order collective effects.

**Setup**: Choose \( N \gg 1 \) zeros (e.g.\ \( N = 5 \) or 10) at heights \( \{ \gamma_j \} \) (for example, the first \( N \) zeros of the zeta, or \( N \) random values). Define \( S_c = \{ 1/2 + i \gamma_j \} \). We perform a uniform perturbation: shift all zeros by the same small \( \delta \). Vary \( \delta \in [-\Delta, \Delta] \) as before. Optionally, consider a random perturbation vector \( (\delta_1, \dots, \delta_N) \) with each \( \delta_j \) drawn from a small normal distribution, and measure the induced \( \Delta E \).

**Data collected**: Compute \( \Delta E_{N}(\delta) = E[\{ 1/2 + \delta + i \gamma_j \}] - E[S_c] \) for the uniform shift. Also compute the sum of individual \( \Delta E_1(\delta) + \dots + \Delta E_N(\delta) \) if perturbing each zero alone (from previous runs). Define total interference ratio analogously. Collect \( \Delta E_N(\delta) \) across the \( \delta \)-range.

**Expected plots**: Plot \( \Delta E_{N} \) vs.\ \( \delta \); it should behave like \( \left( \sum C_1(\gamma_j) \right) \delta^2 \) plus smaller corrections. We expect \( \Delta E_N(\delta) / N \) to align with a typical single-zero \( \Delta E \). A log-log plot of \( \Delta E_N \) vs.\ \( \delta \) may show the 2-power law. If random perturbations are used, one can plot \( \Delta E \) vs.\ \( \sum \delta_j^2 \) to check quadratic scaling.

**Statistical plan**: Fit \( \Delta E_N(\delta) \) to a polynomial in \( \delta \) to extract effective coefficients \( C_1^{(N)} \) and \( C_2^{(N)} \). Compare \( C_1^{(N)} \) to \( \sum_{j=1}^N C_1(\gamma_j) \) (estimated from single-zero tests). Compute the relative discrepancy and its confidence interval via bootstrapping. Fit \( \Delta E_N \) vs.\ \( N \) (for fixed small \( \delta \)) to test linearity: e.g.\ regress \( \Delta E_N / N \) against \( N \) or perform an ANOVA. Use bootstrap to estimate error bars on the multi-zero fits. Evaluate \( p \)-values for hypotheses like “\( C_1^{(N)} = \sum_j C_1(\gamma_j) \)” and “interference effect \( C_2^{(N)} \) is negligible compared to \( C_1^{(N)} \).”

Each experiment’s data analysis will include numerical fitting (quadratic or cubic) and validation: checking residuals, estimating uncertainties (via bootstrap or asymptotic formulas), and constructing confidence intervals for the key coefficients. P-values will be reported for tests of positivity of \( C_1 \) and insignificance of higher-order terms. Collectively, these studies will inform the stability of the critical line under the proposed energy functional.

**Sources**: Definitions and symmetry properties of \( E[S] \) and \( D(s) \) are adapted from the Weil-explicit-formula framework [vixra.org](https://vixra.org) [vixra.org](https://vixra.org). The local-minimum behavior of \( E \) at the critical line is established in. We use these results to motivate the conjectured expansion \( \Delta E(\delta) = C_1 \delta^2 - \dots \) and the numerical strategy above.
